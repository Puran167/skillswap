# 🗑️ Delete Functionality for Requests

## ✅ Feature Added: Delete Option for Sent and Received Requests

### 📋 Backend Implementation:

#### New API Endpoint:
- **DELETE** `/api/swaps/:id` - Delete a swap request

#### Delete Rules:
1. **Who can delete:**
   - ✅ Requester (person who sent the request)
   - ✅ Responder (person who received the request)

2. **When can delete:**
   - ✅ **Pending requests** - Can be deleted by either party
   - ✅ **Rejected requests** - Can be deleted to clean up the list
   - ❌ **Accepted requests** - Cannot be deleted (preserves history)
   - ❌ **Completed requests** - Cannot be deleted (preserves history)

3. **Smart Notifications:**
   - When responder deletes a pending request → Requester gets "declined" notification
   - When requester deletes → No notification needed (they cancelled their own request)

### 🎨 Frontend Implementation:

#### Where Delete Buttons Appear:
1. **Received Requests Tab:**
   - Delete button for pending requests (acts as decline)
   - Delete button for rejected requests (cleanup)

2. **Sent Requests Tab:**
   - Delete button for pending requests (cancel your request)
   - Delete button for rejected requests (cleanup)

#### User Experience:
- **Confirmation dialog** before deletion
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Auto-refresh** list after successful deletion
- **Visual feedback** with appropriate styling

### 🔒 Security Features:
- ✅ **Authorization check** - Only involved parties can delete
- ✅ **History preservation** - Accepted/completed swaps stay for records
- ✅ **Smart notifications** - Automatic notification on responder deletion

### 🧪 Testing the Feature:

1. **Test Pending Request Deletion:**
   - Create a swap request
   - Go to Requests page
   - Click delete on sent request → Should remove immediately
   - Check received requests → Delete button should notify sender

2. **Test Rejected Request Cleanup:**
   - Reject a request
   - Both parties should see delete option
   - Delete removes from list

3. **Test Protection:**
   - Accept a request
   - Delete button should disappear
   - API should prevent deletion

### 📱 UI Features:
- **🗑️ Delete button** with trash icon
- **Gray styling** to indicate secondary action
- **Hover effects** for better UX
- **Confirmation prompt** prevents accidents
- **Error messages** for failed deletions

The delete functionality is now fully implemented and ready to use! 🎉
